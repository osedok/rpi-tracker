    An attempt to eliminate the need of third parties for remote gps tracking.
    
    This bash script configures the raspberry pi to log data from a
    TTL serial GPS device and surrounding WiFi access points, 
    for additional geolocation. The script uploads this data to an ssh 
    server after establishing an internet connection using wpa_supplicant, 
    which is set to roam for open WiFi access points.
    
    The GPS logs are in NMEA format and can be used with any software 
    that supports it.

    The GPS logs along with other information is stored in the 
    /root/geo-data to be stage for upload. The data is then deleted 
    upon a successful upload.

    It also has an option if desired to use an icmp tunnel for uploading data 
    using the ptunnel package. In order to use this feature you need to have 
    a ptunnel proxy for your device (rpi) to establish the tunnel.

    INSTALL
    This script is made for the raspberry pi, to use on other platforms
    one will need to specifiy the gps device using the GPSDEVICE variable. 
  
    you first will need to edit the variable options in tracker.conf
    then run install.sh as root/sudo the necessary files will be
    placed in /root/tracking-engine/ 
    
    Configuration changes must be made to tracking.conf the install.sh
    will not function with default variables.
    
    VARIABLES/OPTIONS: for tracking.conf   
    
    GPSDEVICE - for the GPIO pins on the RPi is /dev/ttyAMA0
                for USB devices it *may* be /dev/ttyUSB0    

    PINGTN - (on || off)  This activates the option to us a ping tunnel
    
    PTIP - ptunnel proxy IP, if the PINGTN option is on this is required 
    
    PASS - password for the ptunnel password
    
    USR - username to be used with ssh 
    
    PORT - the configured port for ssh, the default is 22

    IP - IP address or domain of ssh reporting server
    
     This is were it can get tricky if also using ptunnel. Depending on 
     your set up you may have a dedicated ptunnel proxy and a separate 
     dedicated ssh server each with there own IP addresses. 
     
     For example: 
        
     |rpi:1.1.1.1|->--->---->--|PTIP:3.3.3.3|-->-->-->-|IP:5.5.5.5:22| 
        
        
     But if the if the ptunnel proxy is also used for ssh then 
     it would look like this.
        
     |rpi.1.1.1.1|->--->--->---|PTIP:3.3.3.3   |
                               |IP:localhost:22|                                 
        
     This script is designed for having the ptunnel proxy on the same 
     server as the ssh service otherwise you will have to edit the 
     scripts if failed statement. If the tunnel fails it will 
     retry to connect directly to the PTIP variable without a tunnel. 
             
    
    
    ******************************IMPORTANT*****************************
    
    The authentication for ssh relies on public keys so these must be 
    imported manually to the server from the client device (rpi).
    
    Create them with ssh-keygen and import the id_rsa.pub to 
    the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys of the specified user in the 
    reporting server, don't use server root for this.
    
    Don't forget about the server's ssh fingerprint.
    
    This can be done using ssh-keyscan
    [ssh-keyscan -p port -t rsa,ecdsa "server_ip_or_domain" >> ~/.ssh/know_hosts]
    
    The port option is metioned due to it's relevance when you are using the
    ptunnel option. You will need to import the fingerprint when you
    log into the ssh server through the tunnel even though you may
    already have sshed to it directly, as the ip/domain will be different 
    (127.0.0.1/localhost). 

    You can hash these inputs in the know_hosts file with 
    the "ssh-keygen -H" option. 
    
    Also when using ptunnel the know_hosts fingerprint may still prompt 
    you since it detects a different ip than when ssh into the server
    without a tunnel so either use the above method and change the ip 
    to localhost in the know_hosts file before hashing it or log in manually 
    once to the server through the tunnel to update this file or just turn 
    off the fingerprint checks by turning off stricthostkeychecking option 
    in the global /etc/ssh/sshd_config (not recommended).
    
    
    For specifics on using ptunnel use the --help option for details. 
    Be sure to run it with a password if using it as a proxy to prevent 
    just anyone from using it.
    
    To run it from boot one can use cron. 
    
    @reboot root /usr/bin/ptunnel -x "some_password" &
        

    PROBLEMS?
    Be aware that some routers throttle ping traffic due to DOS mitigation 
    firewall rules which may prevent the ping tunnel from being established.
    
    for example
    ACCEPT   icmp  --  *   *   0.0.0.0/0   0.0.0.0/0   limit: avg 1/sec burst 5 
    
    [keep in mind that the ping tunnel feature is designed to increase the 
    percentage of usable access points and will not work on all routers.]

    Also ptunnel is set by the script to listen on the wlan interfaces so if 
    you want to test it over an wired interface (eth0) you will have to 
    edit the following from rpi-tracker.sh.

    FROM: ptunnel -p $PTIP -lp 8080 -da $IP -dp $PORT -c $wlan -x $PASS &
    TO: ptunnel -p $PTIP -lp 8080 -da $IP -dp $PORT -c eth(your number) -x $PASS &   
    
    
    As stated before this uses wpa_supplicant for managing wireless 
    connections. To add known WiFi networks refer to [man wpa_supplicant.conf] 
    in the terminal for precise details on how to best do this.
